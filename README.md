# Colemak Club
This repo is a backup of [Colemak Club](https://github.com/gnusenpai/colemakclub), which is a fork of [Colemak Academy](https://colemak.academy/), a resource for learning Colemak and related keyboard layouts. The main purpose of Colemak Club was to fix the very incorrect implementation of Colemak-DH in Colemak Academy's version. It was starting to become quite a problem for the [Colemak Community](https://discordapp.com/invite/3UkgpGC), as many were investing significant time into learning the wrong layout!
However, this fork is now a platform for the community to add additional improvements.

Colemak Club is currently hosted on GNU Senpai's website at [gnusenpai.net](https://gnusenpai.net/colemakclub/) and alternatively on GNU Senpai's [GitHub Pages](https://gnusenpai.github.io/colemakclub/).

# Colemak Camp
Colemak Camp has made a backup of Colemak Club as a separate repo before working on it because extensive changes were planned, so much so that upstream changes could not be merged automatically anymore, which is what one would expect out of forks. So, instead, this backup will serve as a copy of the source and changes will be observed here for reference. Any upstream changes that appear to be necessary in Colemak Camp will then be ported over manually.

Colemak Camp is currently being updated on [this repo](https://github.com/ColemakCamp/colemakcamp.github.io), and it is hosted online on the organization's [Github Pages](https://colemakcamp.github.io/).
